## Hi, I'm Dieudonne ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I'm a passionate programmer whose journey began at Algonquin College, where I developed skills in Web Development and Internet Applications. Currently, I work as a Service Desk Professional at 2Keys, an Interac Company, while pursuing my goal of becoming a full-stack software developer.

My expertise lies in backend development, with hands-on experience in C#, JavaScript, REST APIs, PHP, SQL, and PostgreSQL. I also have a solid background in RDBMS, TCP/IP, and IT support, which provides me with a well-rounded understanding of technology.

Iâ€™m driven by continuous learning and personal growth, and Iâ€™m deeply interested in networking, AI development, cybersecurity, and organizational behavior. On this GitHub, you'll find a collection of my projects and contributions that reflect my passion for technology and problem-solving. I'm always seeking new challenges and opportunities to expand my horizons and make meaningful contributions to the tech community.
